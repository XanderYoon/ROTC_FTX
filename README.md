Overview:
The Cadet Field Training Exercise (FTX) is a critical component of military training, serving as a comprehensive evaluation of a cadet's skills and readiness. This project involved the analysis of FTX performance data to gain insights into cadet performance, uncover potential biases in instructor gradings, and identify performance trends across different schools.

Objectives:

Data Collection and Cleaning:
Gathered historical FTX performance data, including scores, cadet details, and instructor feedback. Imported the CSV into Python and proceeded to format accordingly. 

Graphical Modeling:
Created visual representations of FTX performance data using various graphical models, such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.
These graphs were designed to provide a comprehensive view of cadet performance trends over time.

Bias Identification:
Utilized statistical analysis to identify potential biases in instructor gradings.
Examined factors like cadet demographics, instructor backgrounds, and grading consistency to pinpoint sources of bias.
Performance Trends:
